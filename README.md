burnedpopcorn here

I upgraded SimpleRIFF and the Main Project to use .NET 8
So use that instead

I am also NOT affilated with anyone in this repo
I have never met them, and probably never will
I'm just here to preserve something that had potential

Also, the original SimpleRIFF library is at the moment Lost Media
So I had to Decompile it using ILSpy, which worked after a few changes

Lastly, the original password was: Y0uR3411yTh0ught1dG1v3Th3C0d34w4y?
So yeah, it really was right in front of us
But the super secret "gamemaker decompiler" was actually just a string decompiler
so not including that because it is basically useless
